Next Generation Index (NGI)
A Tokenized Next-Generation Crypto Index
🔹 About the Project
NGI is a decentralized index of top altcoins, excluding BTC and ETH. It updates quarterly, ensuring a balanced distribution of assets.

🔹 Key Features
Equilibrium Principle – Each asset in the index is purchased in 1 unit.
Token Filtering – Only tokens with a ≥ $1 price and listed on Binance, Coinbase, or Uniswap are included.
Automatic Rebalancing – Updates occur on March 20, June 20, September 20, and December 20.
DAO Governance – Holders can vote on emergency index composition changes.
🔹 NGI Token
NGI is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum that reflects the index's performance.

Token Mechanics
✔ Buyback & Burn – A portion of transaction fees is used to buy and burn NGI.
✔ Liquidity Farming – NGI/ETH and NGI/USDC pools on Uniswap.
✔ DAO Governance – NGI holders participate in index composition decisions.

🔹 Data Sources
🔹 CoinMarketCap API is used for asset selection and analysis.
🔹 Integration with Uniswap, Aave, and Curve for liquidity and value growth.

🔹 Security Measures
✔ Internal audit before launch.
✔ CertiK audit before public release.

🔹 Roadmap
1️⃣ Develop & test the smart contract (Solidity, Hardhat).
2️⃣ Internal audit → CertiK audit.
3️⃣ Launch on Uniswap and list on aggregators (DEXTools, etc.).
4️⃣ Implement DAO governance and voting mechanisms.
