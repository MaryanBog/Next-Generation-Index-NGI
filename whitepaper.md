Next Generation Index (NGI) â€“ Whitepaper
1. Introduction
The Next Generation Index (NGI) is a decentralized crypto index designed to provide stable and balanced exposure to the top-performing altcoins while excluding BTC and ETH. NGI offers a transparent, automated, and DAO-governed approach to crypto index investing.

2. NGI Concept
NGI operates on an equilibrium principle, meaning each selected asset is bought in 1 unit regardless of price.
The index composition is updated quarterly (March 20, June 20, September 20, December 20).
NGI is fully tokenized as an ERC-20 token and tradable on Uniswap.
3. Asset Selection Criteria
Price â‰¥ $1 at the time of the quarterly update.
Listed on at least one major exchange (Binance, Coinbase, or Uniswap).
Automatic exclusion of tokens delisted from these exchanges.
Emergency adjustments through DAO voting.
4. Tokenization & Mechanics
4.1 NGI Token
NGI is a fully decentralized ERC-20 token on Ethereum.
It represents a basket of assets selected based on the index methodology.
4.2 Buyback & Burn Model
A percentage of fees from NGI transactions will be used for a buyback & burn mechanism, reducing supply over time.
4.3 Liquidity Farming & Yield Strategies
Initial pools on Uniswap:
NGI/ETH and NGI/USDC liquidity pools.
Potential expansion into Aave & Curve for optimized yield.
5. Technical Implementation
5.1 Smart Contract Development
NGI's smart contract will be developed in Solidity using OpenZeppelin standards.
The contract will be audited internally, followed by a CertiK security audit.
Contract deployment and updates will be controlled by DAO governance.
5.2 Data Sources
NGI utilizes CoinMarketCap API for real-time asset selection and pricing.
Integration with DeFi platforms (Uniswap, Aave, Curve) for liquidity and yield generation.
6. Security & Audits
Internal security audit before deployment.
CertiK audit for smart contract verification.
Decentralized governance to mitigate single points of failure.
7. Roadmap & Development Plan
Phase	Tasks	Timeline
Phase 1	Smart contract development & internal testing	2-3 months
Phase 2	Internal audit â†’ CertiK audit	1-2 months
Phase 3	Uniswap launch, liquidity pools setup	1-2 months
Phase 4	DAO governance implementation	1-2 months
8. DAO Governance
NGI will be governed by Aragon or Snapshot DAO.
Voting rights will be distributed based on NGI token holdings.
DAO will oversee index rebalancing, protocol upgrades, and treasury management.
9. Conclusion
NGI is designed to offer a transparent, automated, and decentralized approach to crypto index investing. Through a robust selection process, DAO governance, and DeFi integration, NGI aims to provide a long-term sustainable investment solution in the crypto space.
